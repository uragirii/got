# got

A very basic git client written in golang. This project isn't meant to be a complete git client but a project for me to learn golang. I will only implement some very common used git commands and flags. My longterm goal is that this repo can be tracked by both the git client and the got binary. Probably use them interchangebly.

### List of commands implemented

As its not feasible to build a complete git clone, I've will only implement the most famous git commands used. Added support for :

- [ ] git init
- [ ] git add
- [ ] git commit
- [ ] git checkout
- [ ] git push
- [ ] git pull

Along with the common ones I've also implemented a few complex ones that you probably won't use in daily life

- [ ] git hash-object
- [ ] git cat-file

## Found a bug / Have suggestions

Great! please open a PR or an issue and I will probably look at it.
